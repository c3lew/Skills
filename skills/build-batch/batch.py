"""Which tickets can be opened at the same time, and the list the client sees.

`plan_batch` is the only real logic in `/build-batch`, and getting it wrong
means two tickets that block each other get opened in parallel — exactly what
the command exists to prevent. So it lives here as a pure function: no `gh`,
no git, no filesystem. SKILL.md tells the agent to fetch the issues and parse
the blocking declarations; only plain data comes in here. `format_plan` is
here for the same reason — the printed list is what the client says yes/no to,
so it is not left as prose the agent improvises.

Ships inside the skill dir because install copies only that dir.

Usage:
    python batch.py --self-check   # run built-in assertions

    tickets: list of dicts with `number`, `state` ("open"/"closed") and
    `blocked_by` (list of issue numbers). Closed tickets are only there as
    blocker state — they never appear in the output.

    `ready` and `queued` are issue numbers. `blocked` carries the reason with
    it — `(number, [blockers still in the way])` — because 「還卡著」 has to
    print 卡在誰後面, and recomputing that in the agent's head would put half
    the judgement back outside the tested seam.

    A ticket is blocked while any blocker is still open. A blocker that isn't
    in the input at all counts as blocking too: we cannot see that it closed,
    and guessing "probably done" is the one mistake this function must not
    make. It shows up in the 還卡著 list where the client can overrule it.
